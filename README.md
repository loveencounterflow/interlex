# InterLex

## Token Matchers

### Using the `interlex.rx''` Regex Tag Function

* `rx''` is based on [`slevithan/regex`](https://github.com/slevithan/regex)
* `rx''` allows to convert a string into a regular expression object with
  * `rx"[abc]+"` (CoffeeScript) or
  * ```rx`[abc]+`‚Äç``` (JavaScript)
  * Either of the above results in the regular expression `/[abc]+/dvy` with the `d`, `v` and `y` flags
    implicitly set, for which see below.
* In contradistinction to the original `regex''` tag function provided by `slevithan/regex`, the `rx''` tag
  function offers the capability to set additional flags by using JS dotted accessor syntax, which is a
  fancy way to say that when e.g. you have a matcher `rx"[abc]"` to match any of the letters `'a'`, `'b'`,
  `'c'` in a given source, then in order to set the case-**i**nsensitivy flag `i` you can write
  `rx.i"[abc]"` to match any of `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, `'A'`, `'B'`, or `'C'`.

### Producing a Regex Tag Function with `new_regex_tag()`


Using `rx2 = new_regex_tag flags`, it's possible to produce a new regex tag function with a customized set
of [*JS Regular Expression
Flags*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags)
The default regex tag function exported by `interlex`, `rx''`, inherits [extended support for flags and
features some additional implicitly-set
flags](https://github.com/slevithan/regex?tab=readme-ov-file#-flags):

* The **`x` flag is always implicitly set**; it enables (quote) "makes whitespace insignificant and adds
  support for line comments (starting with `#`), allowing you to freely format your regexes for
  readability"; this flag is emulated by `slevithan/regex`.
* The **`v` flag is always implicitly set**; it enables advanced and improved Unicode support and
  overcomes some difficulties with the older `u` flag;
* **The `u` flag is excluded** by the implicit, always-on presence of `v`.
* **The `d` flag is always implicitly set**; it enables indices for matched groups.
* **The `y` flag is always implicitly set**; it enables 'sticky' behavior essential for a lexer.

* this leaves the user to set one or more of the following flags:
  * `g`
  * `i`
  * `m`
  * `s`
* repeating a flag is ignored, so `rx2 = new_regex_tag 'dvy'` just gives a new tag function whose behavior
  is identical to the default tag function, `rx''`
* there's no way to unset a flag

## To Do

* **`[‚Äî]`** can we replace `Level::new_token()` with a shorter API name?
* **`[‚Äî]`** allow positional arguments to `Level::new_token()`: `( name, matcher, cfg )`
* **`[‚Äî]`** bundle `start`, `stop` and later `lnr` &c under `position`?
* **`[‚Äî]`** 'wrap' tokenizing so that handling of line splitting, line numbering is isolated yet transparent
* **`[‚Äî]`** include indices for groups:

  ```
  match = 'aüàØz'.match /^(?<head>[a-z]+)(?<other>[^a-z]+)(?<tail>[a-z]+)/d
  { match.groups..., }
  { match.indices.groups..., }
  ```

* **`[‚Äî]`** rename result of `new_regex_tag` to reflect use of flags
* **`[‚Äî]`** during matching, ensure that when lexeme was produced it did consume text
  * **`[‚Äî]`** is it possible and useful to allow regular lexemes that take up zero space akin to special
    lexemes (to be written) that indicate start, end, change of level?
* **`[‚Äî]`** extend sanity checks for matcher regex:
  * **`[‚Äî]`** must not have `g`?
  * **`[‚Äî]`** must have `d`
  * **`[‚Äî]`** must have `v` not `u`?
* **`[‚Äî]`** allow functions for `token.matcher`?
  * must accept `( start, text, { token, level, grammar, } )`
  * must return `null` or a lexeme
* **`[‚Äî]`** allow string for `token.matcher`?
* **`[‚Äî]`** when using regex for `token.matcher`, should we **(1)** update flags or **(2)** reject regexes
  without required flags?‚ÄîSee what `slevithan/regex` does with `v` flag (throws `Error: Implicit flags
  v/u/x/n cannot be explicitly added`)

## Is Done

* **`[+]`** implement chunk numbering with CFG settings `{ counter_name: 'line_nr', counter_start: 1, }`
* **`[+]`** ensure that no tokens with non-sticky matchers are instantiated
