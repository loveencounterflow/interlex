# InterLex

## Token Matchers

### `new_regex_tag()`

* using `rx2 = new_regex_tag flags`, it's possible to produce a new RegEx tag function with a customized set
  of [*JS Regular Expression
  Flags*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags)
* the default RegEx tag function exported by `interlex`, `rx''`, has flags `v`, `d` and `y` set
  * `v` enables advanced and improved Unicode support and overcomes some difficulties with the older `u`
    flag;
  * `d` enables indices for matched groups;
  * `y` enables 'sticky' behavior essential for a lexer.
* this leaves the user to set one or more of the following flags:
  * `g`
  * `i`
  * `m`
  * `s`
* repeating a flag is ignored, so `rx2 = new_regex_tag 'dvy'` just gives a new tag function whose behavior
  is identical to the default tag function, `rx''`
* there's no way to unset a flag

## To Do

* **`[â€”]`** can we replace `Level::new_token()` with a shorter API name?
* **`[â€”]`** allow positional arguments to `Level::new_token()`: `( name, matcher, cfg )`
* **`[â€”]`** bundle `start`, `stop` and later `lnr` &c under `position`?
* **`[â€”]`** 'wrap' tokenizing so that handling of line splitting, line numbering is isolated yet transparent
* **`[â€”]`** include indices for groups:

  ```
  match = 'aðŸˆ¯z'.match /^(?<head>[a-z]+)(?<other>[^a-z]+)(?<tail>[a-z]+)/d
  { match.groups..., }
  { match.indices.groups..., }
  ```

* **`[â€”]`** rename result of `new_regex_tag` to reflect use of flags
* **`[â€”]`** during matching, ensure that when lexeme was produced it did consume text
  * **`[â€”]`** is it possible and useful to allow regular lexemes that take up zero space akin to special
    lexemes (to be written) that indicate start, end, change of level?

## Is Done

* **`[+]`** implement chunk numbering with CFG settings `{ counter_name: 'line_nr', counter_start: 1, }`
* **`[+]`** ensure that no tokens with non-sticky matchers are instantiated
